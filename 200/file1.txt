I am happy to join with you. 
today in what will go down in history ,as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation..
Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice.
It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of bad captivity.
